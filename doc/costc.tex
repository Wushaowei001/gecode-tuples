  \caption{Varying the maximum cost per transition. The other parameters are fixed. Number of states=7, size of alphabet=10, and number of steps=7. The lack of an obvious dependence pattern between the x and y axis is because the maximum total cost also varies with the cost per transition.}\label{fig:cost}
