  \caption{Varying the maximum cost per transition. The other parameters are fixed: $states=7$, $symbols=10$, and $steps=7$. The lack of an obvious dependence pattern between the $x$ and $y$ axes is because the maximum total cost and minimum total cost also vary with the cost per transition.}\label{fig:cost}
